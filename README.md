# InterviewMaster

## Summary

InterviewMaster allows candidates to automatically monitor any changes in their candidacy. You can simply open the app and give it access to your Gmail account. It will automatically gather all the job application/status/process information! It is fast, simple, and convenient. A decent form will be created, and you can also manually modify the form by writing down some comments and even copying and pasting your referrers' name/LinkedIn link. 

## Objective

Since we are still at the first phase of our project, the initial objective is Acquisition (Acquiring more users)

## User Segment

Total addressable users: Anyone who needs a job
Serviceable available users: Anyone applying for a job/will be applying for a job shortly.
Core users (for now): students graduating in the following months and have an urgent demand of getting a job/landing somewhere/bullshit with their friends

## User Story/User Case


1. Activation: Login/Sign up
2. Sign up: Email/Phone #/SSO
3. login: Email/Phone #/SSO
4. Retention: Extract/Modify Data 
5. Extract: open the app -> automatically extract interviews info from your emails.
6. Modify: do any modifications on the location, time, time zone, interviewer, zoom link, etc.
7. Referral: Referral: Refer a friend/get a referral from a friend


## Pain Point

During most hiring months, thousands of candidates struggle with submitting applications, getting rejected, scheduling phone calls, 1st rounds, 2nd rounds, final interviews with recruiters, and receiving offers. They can sometimes simply lose themselves when tracking all the application statuses and even forget to schedule important interviews! After receiving numerous invitations, candidates may find it hard to manage their future events and merely have time to prepare for the interviews, especially when they apply for different positions/titles, such as SDE, DS, BA, and Consultant positions at the same time (you will have different strategies for each position). Also, for those positions that take if candidates have a strong referral into consideration, the candidates do not have a place to have a bird's view of all their referrals and may lose track. AST is created to solve this pain point and wants to relieve the stress of all the candidates, they deserve a platform to monitor everything.

## Evaluation

Talk later. can also be divided into 5 buckets acquisition, activation, retention(engagement), revenue, and referral
For example, # of people logged in/# of people exposed to the login page, total # of users, avg # of emails extracted, # emails modified/# emails extracted, avg # of referrals sent

## Risk
3 buckets: Policy, Privacy(Safety), Market(Current Scope/history/future of industry, current/potential competitors)
